Builds Character is a tool for role playing gamers, DMs, and dice game makers to streamline the process of building games and characters. The app contains the following features:

#### Dice Simulator: 
Takes a number of dice to sum, the number of sides on the dice, and a constant to add.
#### Dice Stat Generator:
Takes two "rolls" and generates a graph about which of the two rolls would score more highly or "win" what percent of the time, and another graph of the spread of results for each roll. This tool can help roleplaying game developers decide what types of roles to use for which aspects of their game to maintain balance.
#### Character Builder Tool:
Randomly generates a name (which is Italian--it's a feature, not a bug) which can be replaced with a custom name. Takes a description, gender, and species. The user can add as many stats as they want, lable the stats, and manually input the stat values or randomly generate them with a customized roll of dice. The user can save the characters that they have created.
