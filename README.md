# BuildsCharacter

Builds Character is a tool for role playing gamers, DMs, and dice game makers to streamline the process of building games and characters. The app contains the following features:

#### -A dice simulator: 
Takes a number of dice to sum, the number of sides on the dice, and a constant to add.
#### -A dice stat generator:
Takes two "rolls" and generates graphs about which of the two rolls would score more highly, and the spread of results for each.
#### -A character builder assist tool:
Randomly generates a name (which is Italian--it's a feature, not a bug) which can be replaced with a custom name. Takes a description, gender, and species. The user can add as many stats as they want, lable the stats, and manually input the stat values or randomly generate them with a customized roll of dice. The user can save the characters that they have created.
